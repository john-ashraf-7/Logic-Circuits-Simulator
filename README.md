<h1>Logic-Circuits-Simulator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project creates an event-driven logic circuit simulator that meets specific requirements outlined within the scope of digital circuit simulation, such as inputs, outputs and the time delays. By accepting inputs in the form of a Verilog file (.v), and stimuli file (.stim) which sets the values of the inputs accordingly. The simulator simulates what happens when the input changes from its initial state, which in this simulator is assumed to be 0. This includes the time delay changes and the output changes. This report will dive deeper into the implementation and functionality of this simulator.
